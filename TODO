Pattern library:
* Save patterns in a different format (lists of bools?)
* Select square on world and make into a new pattern (instead of typing in)
* Tag patterns
* Search library by tag/author/name
* Allow mirroring of patterns
* clockwise rotation of patterns
* import a large number of already known patterns
* Find duplicate patterns in library by rotation and mirroring transformations
* use scrolling to show library paging results rather than "previous" and "next"

Evaluation:
* Allow worlds larger that 100x100 (infinite if possible)

Display:
* Show where the pattern will drop on the world before actually placed
* Ensure it works in mobile browsers

Development:
* GET A TEST SUITE IN PLACE!
* Change to using async calls for couchdb

Other:
* Take snapshots and revert to snapshots of the world
* Save snapshots to local storage
